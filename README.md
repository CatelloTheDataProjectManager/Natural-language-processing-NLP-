# Natural language processing (NLP)

*As a Data Project Manager, I've leveraged natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable insights from customer conversations obtained through the [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) API. By applying pre-trained models and customizing them for our use case, I've been able to analyze customer conversations, identify trends, and gain a deeper understanding of customer needs and pain points. This has enabled me to drive data-informed decision making and improve our product and customer experience.*

### 1. Meet the Transformers

🤖 Transformers are deep learning models designed for sequential data like text. They've revolutionized NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and language translation.
Real-world application: Improving search engines, chatbots, and language translation services.

### 2. BERT: Understanding Context

🧠 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) processes text bidirectionally, understanding the context of words in a sentence.
Real-world application: Enhancing search relevance, improving question answering systems, and more.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis: Gauging Emotions

😊 Sentiment analysis helps determine the emotional tone behind words, enabling us to understand public opinion or customer feedback.
Real-world application: Analyzing social media posts, customer reviews, or any text data to gauge sentiment.

### 4. DistilBERT: Efficient Language Understanding

🌱 DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT, retaining most of its language understanding capabilities while being more efficient.
Real-world application: Enabling quick and efficient model adaptation, even in resource-constrained environments.

### 5. Classification: Categorizing Text

📂 Classification involves grouping text into predefined categories based on features or characteristics.
Real-world application: Sentiment analysis, spam detection, text categorization, and more.

### 6. Zero-shot Classification: Adapting to New Categories

🎯 Zero-shot classification allows models to categorize text into new, unseen categories without retraining.
Real-world application: Quickly adapting pre-trained models to new tasks or domains.

### 7. Text Generation: Creating Coherent Text

📝 Text generation involves creating coherent and contextually relevant text based on an initial input or prompt.
Real-world application: Writing assistance, story generation, chatbots, and other creative text generation tasks.

### 8. GPT-2: Generating Human-like Text

🤖 GPT-2 is a large-scale language model developed by OpenAI for generating human-like text.
Real-world application: Text generation, creative writing, and more.

### 9. Fill-Mask: Understanding Context

🔍 The fill-mask task involves predicting the most likely word(s) to fill in a masked token in a sentence.
Real-world application: Language modeling, text completion, and understanding context in NLP tasks.

### 10. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying Entities

🔎 NER helps identify and classify named entities in a text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more.
Real-world application: Information extraction, data annotation, and enhancing search functionality.

### 11. Summarization: Condensing Information

📜 Summarization generates a concise and coherent summary of a longer text.
Real-world application: Automatic summarization of news articles, research papers, or any long text data.

### 12. Translation: Breaking Language Barriers

🌍 Machine translation converts text from one language to another using pre-trained models.
Real-world application: Multilingual communication, breaking down language barriers, and enabling global communication.

### 13. Addressing Biases and Limitations

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Bias and limitations in pre-trained language models can impact NLP applications. We'll explore techniques to mitigate these issues.
Real-world application: Ensuring fairness and reducing biases in NLP applications, such as hiring processes, customer service, or content generation.

### 14. PyTorch: Building and Deploying AI Models

🔧 PyTorch is an open-source framework for machine learning and artificial intelligence, enabling us to build, train, and deploy advanced AI models, including transformer-based models.
Real-world application: Developing custom NLP models, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and more.

### 15. Tokenizers: Preparing Text for Models

🔄 Tokenizers convert text into a sequence of tokens (or words) for language processing models, making text processing more efficient.
Real-world application: Enabling efficient text processing and input preparation for NLP models.
